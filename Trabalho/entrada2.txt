@footie_matters;goal! it's been given!nakajimas goal stands and japan have the lead. ecuador have it all to do now . .. #copaamerica;2;3
@footie_matters;great chance for ecuador! velasco centres the ball into the box for enner valencia, but he can't guide it into the goal from close range and kawashima saves. it looked easier to score #copaamerica;1;1
